    "###### *Your solution to an incredibly specific problem.*\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Mic-Suite (formerly VRC-Mic-Suite) is a set of python scripts that perform various audio operations. The main purpose of this project is to put audio and your microphone into a single audio loopback device. I usually use a physical cable, but something like [VB-Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) will work fine and probably better.\n",
    "## Building\n",
    "The `/source/mic.py` Python script relies upon a `/source/heavyeffects.cpp` which you can run this `Python` snippet to download the `.dll` or `.so` from the `Github` repo, or you can build it yourself."
