# Mic-Suite
###### Formerly VRC-Mic-Suite

Mic-Suite (VRCMS) is an open-source alternative to proprietary tools like Voicemod. [Search for Voicemod](https://www.google.com/search?q=voicemod) online and you’ll find clickbait, shady user tactics, and, frankly, a lot I’d rather avoid.

Although VRCMS is a bit weaker at the moment, it remains a strong open-source solution due to its versatile scripts and wide range of use cases. Its open-source nature makes it easy to add features not yet in the main repository—or remove ones you don’t need. In VRCMS, the repo is truly your oyster.

## Privacy
***"You don't  
You can't  
Even if you can, you don't want to"***

You would never sacrifice your privacy willy-nilly online, so why give it away for a real-time audio engine? It just doesn’t make sense. With VRCMS, I have no need for your personal information. Take a look at the scripts: do you see anything that tries to *export* your *personal information* to **some server** or *track your every move*? No. No, you don’t.

# Closing
There exists a DOC.md file at the root of the repo. Within a guide on every script has been written.
